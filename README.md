# Autonomous-Vehicles
This Specialization gives you a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the self-driving car industry.You'll get to interact with real data sets from an autonomous vehicle (AV)―all through hands-on projects using the open source simulator CARLA.Throughout your courses, you’ll hear from industry experts who work at companies like Oxbotica and Zoox as they share insights about autonomous technology and how that is powering job growth within the field.
You’ll learn from a highly realistic driving environment that features 3D pedestrian modelling and environmental conditions. 
When you complete the Specialization successfully, you’ll be able to build your own self-driving software stack and be ready to apply for jobs in the autonomous vehicle industry.
This repository includes the programming assignments and projects for the 4 course Self Driving Cars Specialization by University of Toronto on Coursera.
